# Bitcoin Price Forecasting with Time Series and Regression Models

## Overview
This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating various models for forecasting Bitcoin daily closing prices. It includes implementations of Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models using historical Bitcoin price data.

## Features
- **Data Visualization**: Utilizes Plotly and Matplotlib for interactive and static visualizations of Bitcoin daily closing prices.
- **Model Implementation**: Implements Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and ARIMA models for price forecasting.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluates model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. Conducts time series cross-validation for robust evaluation.
- **Residual Analysis**: Analyzes residuals to assess model adequacy and correctness.
